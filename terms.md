If _Client_ requires _Developer_ to use and return specific equipment, _Client_ agrees to pay the costs of packaging and shipping, both ways. If _Client_ cannot pay a cost directly, _Client_ agrees to advance _Developer_ the cost. See [Cover Basic Expenses](#cover-basic-expenses) for _Developer_'s obligation to pay other expenses.

### Use the Agreed Payment Method

_Client_ agrees to make all payments under this agreement via the _Payment Method_.

### Cover Payment Method Costs

_Client_ agrees to increase the amount of each payment to _Developer_ so that _Developer_ receives the full amount owed, taking into account any costs of receiving payment via the _Payment Method_.

### Track Time

### Standard Public Licenses

Terms under which _Developer_ grants licenses under [Public Licenses](#public-licenses) will be interpreted as entirely independent legal documents, without reference to these terms or the circumstances of _Developer_ and _Client_'s agreement.
